A guitar player's generator for endless exercises --

Hi!

This is sort of a flashcard for guitar players to test their own abilities. Right now, there is no built in referencing system to see shapes, diagrams or included notes.

(Note: that means this app won't teach you anything! all it does is give you a random exercise to play.)

Right now the generator plucks from a sample of keys (or roots for chords) then generates different exercises (chords or scales).

Features that are coming:
- Randomized .less schemes for prettiness!
- Customizable difficulty levels
- Randomized chord progressions for better improvisation
